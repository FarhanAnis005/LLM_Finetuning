### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the smallest two-digit number:** The smallest two-digit number you can form using those digits is 10 (formed by 1 and 0).

2. **Set up the equation:** Let "x" be the number we're trying to find. The problem states: 10 - x = 7

3. **Solve for x:**  Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
   -x = -3
   Divide both sides by -1:
   x = 3


**Therefore, the number is 3.**

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the smallest two-digit number:**

* The smallest two-digit number can be formed by using the smallest digits, which are 2 and 3.
* So, the smallest two-digit number is 23.

**2. Set up the equation:**

* Let the unknown number be represented by 'x'.
* The problem states: 23 - x = 7

**3. Solve for x:**

* Subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: -x = -16
* Multiply both sides by -1: x = 16


**Answer:** The number is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Understand the problem:** We need to find out how many Indian Rupees (INR) are equal to 1 British Pound (GBP).

* **Set up the calculation:**  
   * Raj exchanged 140 GBP for 14000 INR.
   * To find the exchange rate, divide the amount of INR by the amount of GBP: 14000 INR / 140 GBP = 100 INR/GBP

* **Answer:** The exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 INR/GBP. This means 1 British Pound is equal to 100 Indian Rupees.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 3, 4, 0, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8) is 30, because 0 cannot be the first digit of a two-digit number. If this number (30) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 30 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 30 - 7 x = 23 So, the certain number is 23.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 1, 8, and 9 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Find the smallest two-digit number:**  The smallest two-digit number you can make with these digits is 13 (remember, 0 can't be the first digit).

2. **Set up the equation:** Let "x" represent the unknown number. The problem states: 13 - x = 7

3. **Solve for x:**
   * Subtract 13 from both sides: -x = -6
   * Multiply both sides by -1: x = 6


**Therefore, the certain number is 6.**

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?
To find the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar, we need to divide the amount of Korean Won Soojeong received by the amount of US Dollars she exchanged. So, the exchange rate (KRW/USD) is: 158,760 KRW / 140 USD = 1,134 KRW/USD Therefore, the exchange rate is 1,134 Korean Won to 1 US Dollar.
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Igor came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rubles in at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British Pounds, we need to divide the amount of Russian Rubles Igor received by the amount of British Pounds he exchanged. So, the exchange rate (RUB/GBP) is: 14000 RUB / 140 GBP = 100 RUB/GBP Therefore, the exchange rate is 100 Russian Rubles to 1 British Pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Monday:**

* Found: 36 bottle caps
* Threw away: 45 bottle caps
* Net change: 36 - 45 = -9 bottle caps (He lost 9)

**Tuesday:**

* Found: 58 bottle caps
* Threw away: 30 bottle caps
* Net change: 58 - 30 = 28 bottle caps (He gained 28)

**Wednesday:**

* Found: 80 bottle caps
* Threw away: 70 bottle caps
* Net change: 80 - 70 = 10 bottle caps (He gained 10)

**Total Change:**

*  -9 + 28 + 10 = 29 bottle caps

**Answer:** Danny found 29 more bottle caps than he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of girls:** 706 girls + 418 girls = 1124 girls

2. **Calculate the total number of students:** 1124 girls + 222 boys = 1346 students

3. **Divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio:** 1346 students / 20 students per teacher = 67.3 teachers

4. **Round up to the nearest whole number:** Since you can't have a fraction of a teacher, the school needs **68 teachers**.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of minutes used on the second phone line.
* Then, 'x + 20' represents the number of minutes used on the first phone line.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* **Cost of the second line:** 4 + 0.10x 
* **Cost of the first line:** 3 + 0.15(x + 20)
* **Total cost:** (4 + 0.10x) + (3 + 0.15(x + 20)) = 56

**3. Solve the Equation:**

* 4 + 0.10x + 3 + 0.15x + 3 = 56
* 0.25x + 10 = 56
* 0.25x = 46
* x = 184 minutes (This is the number of minutes on the second line)

**4. Calculate Total Minutes:**

* Total minutes = x + (x + 20) = 184 + (184 + 20) = 388 minutes



**Answer:** Milan was billed for a total of 388 minutes on both lines.
