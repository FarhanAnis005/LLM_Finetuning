### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
## Step 1: Determine the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given digits.
The smallest two-digit number can be formed by arranging the digits in ascending order, which gives us 34.

## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the given number, the two-digit number formed, and the resulting difference.
We are told that when the smallest two-digit number (34) is subtracted by a certain number, the result is 7.

## Step 3: Formulate an equation based on the given information.
Let's denote the certain number as x. The equation based on the given information is 34 - x = 7.

## Step 4: Solve the equation to find the value of x.
To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation, which gives us -x = 7 - 34. Simplifying this gives us -x = -27.

## Step 5: Solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by -1.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 gives us x = 27.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$ ### Input:
What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 17?

## Step 2: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us 2x = 17 - 5, which simplifies to 2x = 12.

## Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 12 / 2, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$ ### Input:
Solve for x in the equation 3x - 2 = 16.

## Step 2: Add 2 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
Adding 2 to both sides gives us 3x = 16 + 2, which simplifies to 3x = 18.

## Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 18 / 3, which simplifies to x = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$ ### Input:
Solve for x in the equation 4x + 3 = 21.

### Response:
## Step 1: Write down the given equation.

## Step 2: Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us 4x = 21 - 3, which simplifies to 4x = 18.

## Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x.
Dividing both sides by 4 gives us x = 18 / 4, which simplifies to x = 4.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$ ### Input:
Solve for x in the equation 2x - 5 = 11.

### Response:

## Step 2: Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
Adding 5 to both sides gives us 2x = 11 + 5, which simplifies to 2x = 16.

## Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 16 / 2, which simplifies to x = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$ ### Input:
Solve for x in the equation 3x + 2 = 19.

### Response:
## Step 1: Write down the given equation.
The equation given is 3x + 2 = 19.

## Step 2: Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us 3x = 19 - 2, which simplifies to 3x = 17.

## Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 17 / 3, which simplifies to x = 5.67

### Response:
## Step 1: Determine the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers.
To find the smallest two-digit number, we need to select the smallest two numbers from the given set (5, 3, 4, 8, 2) and multiply them or add them to get the smallest two-digit number. The smallest two numbers are 2 and 3, which can be multiplied or added to form a two-digit number. Multiplying 2 and 3 gives 6, which is not a two-digit number, so we add them to get 5.

## Step 2: Identify the correct smallest two-digit number from the given options.
Since we cannot form a two-digit number by multiplying two numbers from the set, we need to find the smallest two-digit number by adding two numbers from the set. The smallest two-digit number formed by adding two numbers from the set is 5 + 3 = 8, 5 + 4 = 9, 5 + 8 = 13, 3 + 4 = 7, 3 + 8 = 11, 3 + 5 = 8, 4 + 8 = 12, 4 + 5 = 9, 8 + 5 = 13, and 8 + 4 = 12. The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers is 7.

## Step 3: Determine the number that, when subtracted from the smallest two-digit number, results in 7.
The number that, when subtracted from the smallest two-digit number, results in 7 is 0.

## Step 4: Calculate the number that, when subtracted from the smallest two-digit number, results in 7.
The smallest two-digit number is 7. When 0 is subtracted from 7, the result is 7.

## Step 5: Identify the correct number that, when subtracted from the smallest two-digit number, results in 7.
The number that, when subtracted from the smallest two-digit number, results in 7 is 0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$ ### Note: This is a non-standard math word problem.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
## Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found.
To find the total number of bottle caps Danny found, we need to add the bottle caps he found each day: 36 (Monday) + 58 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 174.

## Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny threw away.
To find the total number of bottle caps Danny threw away, we need to add the bottle caps he threw away each day: 45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 145.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total number of bottle caps found and thrown away.
To find the difference, we subtract the total number of bottle caps thrown away from the total number of bottle caps found: 174 - 145 = 29.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$ ### Note:

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school after the new students join and then find the number of teachers required to maintain the 20:1 student-teacher ratio.

First, let's calculate the new total number of students:
706 (original girls) + 222 (original boys) + 418 (new girls) = 1346

Next, let's divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio to find the number of teachers required:
1346 (total students) / 20 (student-teacher ratio) = 67.3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teacher, we will round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the required ratio is maintained:
67.3 → 68

Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers now. 

The final answer is 68.  ### Explanation:
This problem requires the application of basic arithmetic operations and ratio calculations. The student is expected to understand how to calculate the total number of students after the new students join and then use the student-teacher ratio to find the required number of teachers. The solution involves simple division and rounding up to the nearest whole number to ensure the required ratio is maintained.

### Input:
A rectangular garden measures 15 meters by 8 meters. A path that is 2 meters wide is built around the garden. What is the area of the path?

### Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the larger rectangle that includes the path and subtract the area of the garden from it.

First, let's calculate the dimensions of the larger rectangle:
15 (garden length) + 2 (path width) + 2 (path width) = 19
8 (garden width) + 2 (path width) + 2 (path width) = 12

Next, let's calculate the area of the larger rectangle:
19 (length) × 12 (width) = 228

Now, let's calculate the area of the garden:
15 (length) × 8 (width) = 120

Finally, let's subtract the area of the garden from the area of the larger rectangle to find the area of the path:
228 (larger rectangle area) - 120 (garden area) = 108

Therefore, the area of the path is 108 square meters.

The final answer is 108.  ### Explanation:
This problem requires the application of basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The student is expected to understand how to calculate the dimensions of the larger rectangle that includes the path and then use these dimensions to find the area of the path.

The solution involves calculating the area of the larger rectangle, the area of the garden, and then subtracting the area of the garden from the area of the larger rectangle to find the area of the path.

### Input:
A bakery sells 480 loaves of bread per day. They make a profit of $0.50 per loaf. If the bakery operates 7 days a week, how much profit do they make in a week?

### Response:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of loaves sold in a week and then multiply it by the profit per loaf.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold in a week:
480 (loaves per day) × 7 (days per week) = 3360

Next, let's calculate the total profit made in a week:
3360 (loaves per week) × $0.50 (profit per loaf) = $1680

Therefore, the bakery makes a profit of $1680 in a week.

The final answer is 1680.  ### Explanation:
This problem requires the application of basic arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and addition. The student is expected to understand how to calculate the total number of loaves sold in a week and then use this information to find the total profit made in a week.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as $x$. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line, he used the first phone line for $x+20$ minutes. The monthly fee for the first phone line is 3 dollars and for the second phone line is 4 dollars. Therefore, the total monthly fee for both lines is $3 + 4 = 7$ dollars. The cost per minute for the first phone line is 15 cents and for the second phone line is 10 cents. So, the total cost for both lines is $7 + 0.15(x+20) + 0.10x = 56$ dollars. We can simplify this equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
7 + 0.15(x+20) + 0.10x &= 56\\
7 + 0.15x + 3 + 0.10x &= 56\\
10 + 0.25x &= 56\\
0.25x &= 46\\
x &= \frac{46}{0.25} = 184
\end{align*}
Therefore, Milan used the second phone line for 184 minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line, he used the first phone line for $184 + 20 = 204$ minutes. The total number of minutes that Milan was billed for on both lines is $184 + 204 = 388$. The final answer is 388.  ### Input:
Tom has a water tank that can hold 2400 liters of water. The tank is initially empty and is being filled with water at a rate of 100 liters per minute. Tom wants to fill the tank with water to a level of 2000 liters. How many minutes will it take to fill the tank to the desired level?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes it takes to fill the tank to the desired level as $t$. The tank is being filled at a rate of 100 liters per minute. So, the amount of water added to the tank in $t$ minutes is $100t$. Since the tank is initially empty, the amount of water in the tank after $t$ minutes is $100t$. We want to fill the tank to a level of 2000 liters. Therefore, we can set up the equation $100t = 2000$ to solve for $t$. We can simplify this equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
100t &= 2000\\
t &= \frac{2000}{100} = 20
\end{align*}
Therefore, it will take 20 minutes to fill the tank to the desired level. The final answer is 20.  ### Input:
A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold a maximum of 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty and 40 books are placed on it, how many books will be left over after the bookshelf is fully loaded?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of books left over after the bookshelf is fully loaded as $x$. The bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold a maximum of 8 books. Therefore, the bookshelf can hold a maximum of $5 \times 8 = 40$ books. Since the bookshelf is currently empty, we can set up the equation $5 \times 8 - 40 = x$ to solve for $x$. We can simplify this equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
5 \times 8 - 40 &= x\\
40 - 40 &= x\\
x &= 0
\end{align*}
Therefore, there will be 0 books left over after the bookshelf is fully loaded. The final answer is 0.  ### Input:
