### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the number of multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can start by identifying the first multiple of 4 and then counting up to the largest multiple of 4 that is less than 30.

The first multiple of 4 is 4 itself. The next multiple is 8, then 12, and so on. To find the last multiple of 4 before reaching 30, we divide 30 by 4:

\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Since we are looking for whole numbers, the last multiple of 4 before 30 is \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \).

Now, we count the multiples of 4 from 4 to 28:

- First multiple: 4
- Second multiple: 8
- Third multiple: 12
- Fourth multiple: 16
- Fifth multiple: 20
- Sixth multiple: 24
- Seventh multiple: 28

There are a total of **7** multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed using the digits provided (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8), we must consider the rules for forming two-digit numbers:

1. The first digit cannot be zero.
2. We can use each digit only once.

Given these conditions, the smallest two-digit number we can form is \(34\).

Let's denote the certain number that was subtracted as \(x\). According to the problem statement, when this number \(x\) is subtracted from \(34\), the result is \(7\):

\[34 - x = 7\]

Solving for \(x\), we add \(x\) to both sides and subtract \(7\) from both sides:

\[34 - 7 = x\]

\[27 = x\]

Therefore, the number that was subtracted is \(27\).

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the numbers 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2, we need to consider the combinations that form the smallest possible two-digit number.

The smallest two-digit number can be formed using the smallest digits in the tens and ones place. Here, the smallest digit is 2 and the next smallest is 3. Therefore, the smallest two-digit number we can form with these digits is \(23\).

Given that when this number is subtracted by a certain number it becomes 7, we can set up an equation to find the unknown number:

\[23 - x = 7\]

Solving for \(x\), we add \(x\) to both sides and subtract 7 from both sides:

\[23 - 7 = x\]

\[16 = x\]

Therefore, the number is \(16\).

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 punds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To determine the exchange rate between Indian Rupees (INR) and British Pounds (GBP), we can use the information provided about the transaction that Raj completed at the bank.

Given:

1. Raj exchanged 140 British Pounds (GBP) for 14,000 Indian Rupees (INR).
2. We need to find the exchange rate in favor of INR/GBP.

To calculate the exchange rate, we can set up a proportion based on the transaction:

\[ \frac{140 \text{ GBP}}{14,000 \text{ INR}} = \frac{1 \text{ GBP}}{x \text{ INR}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{14,000 \text{ INR}}{140 \text{ GBP}} \]

\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, the exchange rate of Indian Rupees to British Pounds is 100 INR per 1 GBP. This means that 1 British Pound is equivalent to 100 Indian Rupees based on this transaction.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
To determine how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away over the three days, let's first calculate the total number of bottle caps he found and then subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away.

1. **Total bottle caps found:**
   - Monday: \(36\) bottle caps found.
   - Tuesday: \(58\) bottle caps found.
   - Wednesday: \(80\) bottle caps found.

   Total found = \(36 + 58 + 80 = 174\) bottle caps.

2. **Total bottle caps thrown away:**
   - Monday: \(45\) bottle caps thrown away.
   - Tuesday: \(30\) bottle caps thrown away.
   - Wednesday: \(70\) bottle caps thrown away.

   Total thrown away = \(45 + 30 + 70 = 145\) bottle caps.

3. **Difference between found and thrown away:**
   To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away, we subtract the total thrown away from the total found.

   Difference = \(174 - 145 = 29\) bottle caps.

Therefore, Danny found \(29\) more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
To find out how many teachers should be there in the school now, we first need to calculate the total number of students after the new girls joined.

Given:

- Initial number of girls = 706
- Initial number of boys = 222
- Number of new girls = 418

**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of girls after the new girls joined.
\[ \text{Total number of girls} = 706 + 418 = 1124 \]

**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of students (girls + boys) after the new girls joined.
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 1124 (\text{girls}) + 222 (\text{boys}) = 1346 \]

**Step 3:** Use the student-teacher ratio requirement of 20:1 to determine the number of teachers needed.
\[ \text{Student-Teacher Ratio} = 20:1 \]
\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Ratio of students per teacher}} = \frac{1346}{20} \]

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = 67.3 \]

Since the number of teachers cannot be a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number, because even if there is a remainder, it means there would not be enough teachers for every student, potentially leading to some students being without a teacher. Therefore,

\[ \text{Number of teachers required} = 68 \]

So, after accommodating the new students, the school should have **68 teachers** to maintain the required student-teacher ratio of 20:1.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote:

- \(x\) as the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line,
- \(y\) as the number of minutes Milan used the first phone line.

From the problem statement, we have two equations based on the cost structure:

For the first phone line: \(0.15y + 3\)
For the second phone line: \(0.10x + 4\)

The total bill is given by these two amounts added together, which equals $56.00:

\[0.15y + 3 + 0.10x + 4 = 56\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[0.15y + 0.10x = 56 - 7\]
\[0.15y + 0.10x = 49\]

We also know that Milan used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line:

\[y = x + 20\]

Substituting \(y\) from the second equation into the first:

\[0.15(x + 20) + 0.10x = 49\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[0.15x + 3 + 0.10x = 49\]
\[0.25x + 3 = 49\]
\[0.25x = 46\]
\[x = 46 / 0.25\]
\[x = 184\]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 184 minutes.

Using the relationship \(y = x + 20\):

\[y = 184 + 20\]
\[y = 204\]

Therefore, Milan was billed a total of \(184 + 204 = 388\) minutes on both lines.
