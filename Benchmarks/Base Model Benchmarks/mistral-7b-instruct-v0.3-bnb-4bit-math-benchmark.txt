### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the number, we need to list all possible two-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits (0, 3, 4, 6, 8). The possible numbers are: 00, 03, 04, 06, 08, 30, 34, 36, 38, 40, 43, 46, 48, 60, 63, 64, 66, 68, 80, 83, 84, 86, and 88.

We can start by finding the two-digit numbers that equal 7 when subtracted by a certain number. The possible numbers are: 7 + 0, 7 + 3, 7 + 4, 7 + 6, and 7 + 8.

Since the smallest two-digit number is 10, we can eliminate 7 + 0 (which would result in 10, not a two-digit number).

Trying the remaining possibilities, we find that 7 + 3 equals 4, which is not a two-digit number.

Trying 7 + 4, we find that it equals 3, which is also not a two-digit number.

Trying 7 + 6, we find that it equals 1, which is not a two-digit number.

Trying 7 + 8, we find that it equals 0, which is not a two-digit number.

Since none of the possibilities work, there is no solution to the problem. The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 and can be subtracted by a certain number to equal 7 does not exist.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To solve this problem, we first need to find all possible two-digit numbers that can be formed using the given digits. The possible combinations are:

* 55, 53, 54, 58, 52, 35, 33, 34, 38, 32, 45, 43, 44, 48, 42, 85, 83, 84, 82, 25, 23, 24, 28, 22

We then subtract each number from 7 and check if the result is a two-digit number. The only possible result is 23 - 7 = 16, but 16 is not a two-digit number. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

Final answer: There is no solution to this problem.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?
To find the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar, we need to divide the amount of Korean Won Soojeong received by the amount of US Dollars she exchanged. So, the exchange rate (KRW/USD) is: 158,760 KRW / 140 USD = 1,134 KRW/USD Therefore, the exchange rate is 1,134 Korean Won to 1 US Dollar.
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Igor came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rubles in at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds, we need to divide the amount of Russian Rubles Igor received by the amount of British pounds he exchanged. So, the exchange rate (RUB/GBP) is: 14000 RUB / 140 GBP = 100 RUB/GBP Therefore, the exchange rate is 100 Russian Rubles to 1 British Pound.

Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Danny found a total of 36 (from Monday) + 58 (from Tuesday) + 80 (from Wednesday) = 174 bottle caps.

He threw away a total of 45 (from Monday) + 30 (from Tuesday) + 70 (from Wednesday) = 145 bottle caps.

So, Danny found 174 - 145 = 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's find the total number of students before the new girls joined:

Total students = Girls + Boys
Total students = 706 + 222
Total students = 928

Now, let's find the new total number of students after the new girls joined:

New total students = Total students + New girls
New total students = 928 + 418
New total students = 1346

Now, let's find the desired student-teacher ratio:

Desired student-teacher ratio = 20:1
Desired number of students = Desired student-teacher ratio * Number of teachers
Desired number of students = 20 * Number of teachers

Now, let's find the number of teachers required to maintain the desired student-teacher ratio:

Number of teachers = Desired number of students / 20
Number of teachers = 1346 / 20
Number of teachers = 67.3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teacher, we will round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of teachers = 68

So, the school should have 68 teachers now.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
First, let's find the monthly fees for both phone lines:

1. First phone line: 3 dollars
2. Second phone line: 4 dollars

Now, let's find the per-minute fees for both phone lines:

1. First phone line: 15 cents per minute
2. Second phone line: 10 cents per minute

Since Milan used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line, let x be the number of minutes he used on the second phone line. Then, the number of minutes he used on the first phone line is x + 20.

The total cost for the second phone line is the monthly fee plus the cost of the minutes used:

Cost of the second phone line = 4 dollars + (10 cents/minute * x)

The total cost for the first phone line is also the monthly fee plus the cost of the minutes used:

Cost of the first phone line = 3 dollars + (15 cents/minute * (x + 20))

The total cost for both phone lines is 56 dollars:

Total cost = Cost of the second phone line + Cost of the first phone line = 4 dollars + (10 cents/minute * x) + 3 dollars + (15 cents/minute * (x + 20))

Now, we have an equation with two variables (x and the total cost), but we know the total cost, so we can solve for x:

56 dollars = 4 dollars + (10 cents/minute * x) + 3 dollars + (15 cents/minute * (x + 20))

Simplifying the equation:

56 dollars = 7 dollars + 15 cents/minute * (x + 20) + 10 cents/minute * x

Rearranging the equation:

56 dollars - 7 dollars = 15 cents/minute * (x + 20) + 10 cents/minute * x

56 dollars - 7 dollars = 15 cents/minute * x + 15 cents/minute * 20

50 dollars = 300 cents/minute * x

x = 50 dollars / 300 cents/minute = 16.67 minutes

Since the number of minutes must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 17 minutes

Now that we know the number of minutes used on the second phone line, we can find the number of minutes used on the first phone line:

x + 20 = 17 minutes + 20 minutes = 37 minutes

So, Milan was billed for a total of 37 minutes on the first phone line and 17 minutes on the second phone line, for a total of 54 minutes.

### Output:
Milan was billed for a total of 54 minutes on both phone lines. He used 37 minutes on the first phone line and 17 minutes on the second phone line.
