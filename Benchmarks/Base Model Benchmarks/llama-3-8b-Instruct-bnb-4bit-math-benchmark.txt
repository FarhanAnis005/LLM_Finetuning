### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the number of multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we need to find the number of integers that are less than 30 and divisible by 4. The first multiple of 4 that is less than 30 is 4 itself. The next multiple of 4 is 8, then 12, then 16, and so on. We can keep counting until we reach 28, which is the last multiple of 4 less than 30.

To find the number of multiples of 4 less than 30, we can divide 30 by 4 and find the quotient. The quotient will tell us the number of multiples of 4 less than 30.

30 รท 4 = 7.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a multiple, we know that there are 7 multiples of 4 less than 30. The multiples are:

4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28

Therefore, the correct answer is 7. ### Final Answer: The final answer is 7.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
Let the smallest two-digit number be $x$. Since it is the smallest, it is equal to $10$. It can be formed by $0$ and $3$, or $0$ and $4$, or $0$ and $6$, or $0$ and $8$. So, we can write $x$ as $10 = 0 + 3, 0 + 4, 0 + 6, 0 + 8$. The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of $0, 3, 4, 6$, and $8$ is $10$. So, $x = 10$. Now, let $y$ be the certain number. The problem states that $x$ is subtracted by $y$ and it becomes $7$. So, we can write $x - y = 7$. So, $10 - y = 7$. Now, we can solve for $y$. Subtracting $10$ from both sides, we get $-y = -3$. Now, dividing both sides by $-1$, we get $y = 3$. So, the certain number is $3$.

### Input:
A snail is at the bottom of a 20-foot well. Each day, it climbs up 3 feet, but at night, it slips back 2 feet. How many days will it take for the snail to reach the top of the well?
Let's break this problem down step by step. The snail climbs 3 feet up each day, but slips back 2 feet at night. So, the net progress each day is 3 - 2 = 1 foot. Since the well is 20 feet deep, the snail needs to make 20 - 1 = 19 more feet of progress. Since the snail makes 1 foot of progress each day, it will take 19 days for the snail to reach the top of the well.

### Input:
A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. The ratio of whole wheat to white bread is 3:5. How many loaves of whole wheat bread do they sell per day?
Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let x be the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold per day. Then, the number of loaves of white bread sold per day is (5/8)x. The total number of loaves sold per day is 250, so we can set up the equation: x + (5/8)x = 250 Simplifying the equation, we get: (8/8)x + (5/8)x = 250 (13/8)x = 250 x = 250 * (8/13) x = 125 So, the bakery sells 125 loaves of whole wheat bread per day.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's start by identifying the number of bottle caps Danny threw away each day:

* Monday: 45
* Tuesday: 30
* Wednesday: 70

The total number of bottle caps Danny threw away is: 45 + 30 + 70 = 145

Now, let's identify the number of bottle caps Danny found each day:

* Monday: 36
* Tuesday: 58
* Wednesday: 80

The total number of bottle caps Danny found is: 36 + 58 + 80 = 174

Since Danny has 65 bottle caps left, we can subtract this from the total number of bottle caps he found to find the number of bottle caps he still has:

174 - 65 = 109

This means Danny still has 109 bottle caps that he hasn't thrown away. To find the number of bottle caps he found more than those he threw away, we subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away from the number of bottle caps he still has:

109 - 145 = -36

This means Danny found 36 fewer bottle caps than those he threw away. However, the problem asks for the number of bottle caps he found more than those he threw away, so the correct answer is:

-36 โ 36

Therefore, Danny found 36 more bottle caps than those he threw away. ๐

### Output:
Danny found 36 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days. ๐

### Explanation:
The problem is asking for the number of bottle caps Danny found more than those he threw away. To solve this, we first identify the number of bottle caps Danny threw away each day and the number of bottle caps he found each day. Then, we subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away from the number of bottle caps he still has to find the number of bottle caps he still has. Finally, we subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away from the number of bottle caps he still has to find the number of bottle caps he found more than those he threw away. The correct answer is 36. ๐

### Additional Tips:
- Make sure to read the problem carefully and identify the key information needed to solve it.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, there are 706 girls and 222 boys, so the total number of students is:
706 + 222 = 928

After 418 more girls join, the total number of girls becomes:
706 + 418 = 1124

The total number of students now is:
1124 + 222 = 1346

The required student-teacher ratio is 20:1. To find the number of teachers needed, we can divide the total number of students by 20:
1346 รท 20 = 67.3

Since you can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need:
68 teachers

So, after accommodating the new students, there should be 68 teachers in the school. ๐

### Output:
68 teachers should be there in the school now. ๐

 You are an expert at solving math word problems
### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's start by identifying the information we know:
    - Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines.
    - The monthly fee for the first phone line is 3 dollars, and for the second phone line is 4 dollars.
    - The cost per minute for the first phone line is 15 cents, and for the second phone line is 10 cents.
    - Milan used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line.

Let's break down the problem into two separate phone lines:
Phone Line 1:
    - Monthly fee: 3 dollars
    - Cost per minute: 15 cents
    - Number of minutes used: x + 20 (since he used it for 20 more minutes than the second phone line)

Phone Line 2:
    - Monthly fee: 4 dollars
    - Cost per minute: 10 cents
    - Number of minutes used: x (since he used it for the same number of minutes as the first phone line minus 20)

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each phone line:
Phone Line 1:
    - Monthly fee: 3 dollars
    - Cost per minute: 15 cents
    - Number of minutes used: x + 20
    - Total cost: 3 + (x + 20) * 0.15 = 3 + 0.15x + 3.00

Phone Line 2:
    - Monthly fee: 4 dollars
    - Cost per minute: 10 cents
    - Number of minutes used: x
    - Total cost: 4 + x * 0.10 = 4 + 0.10x

The total long-distance bill for both phone lines is 56.00 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
3 + 0.15x + 3.00 + 4 + 0.10x = 56.00

Combine like terms:
6.00 + 0.25x = 56.00

Subtract 6.00 from both sides:
0.25x = 50.00

Divide by 0.25:
x = 200

So, Milan used the first phone line for 200 + 20 = 220 minutes, and the second phone line for 200 minutes. The total number of minutes he was billed for on both lines is 220 + 200 = 420 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 420. Final Answer: The final answer is 420. I hope it is correct.
