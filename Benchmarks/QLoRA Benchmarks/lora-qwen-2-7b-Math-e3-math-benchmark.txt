### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can start with the first multiple of 4, which is 4 itself, and then keep adding 4 until we reach a number that is greater than or equal to 30.

The first few multiples of 4 are:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28

We can see that 30 is not included because it is not less than 30. So, the multiples of 4 that are less than 30 are:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28

There are 7 multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given digits (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8), we need to choose the smallest non-zero digit for the tens place and the next smallest digit for the ones place. 

The smallest non-zero digit is 3, and the next smallest digit is 4. Therefore, the smallest two-digit number we can form with these digits is 34.

Now, we know that when this number is subtracted by a certain number, it becomes 7. Let's call this certain number "x". So we have:

34 - x = 7

To find the value of x, we add x to both sides of the equation:

34 = 7 + x

Then, we subtract 7 from both sides to isolate x:

34 - 7 = x

27 = x

So the number that was subtracted is 27.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (5, 3, 4, 8, and 2), we need to select the smallest two numbers from the list. The smallest two numbers in the list are 2 and 3.

So, the smallest two-digit number we can form with these two numbers is 23.

Let's call the certain number we are looking for "x". According to the problem, when we subtract x from 23, we get 7.

So, we have the equation:

23 - x = 7

To find x, we can solve the equation for x:

x = 23 - 7
x = 16

Therefore, the number is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the amount of Indian Rupees (INR) received by the amount of British Pounds (GBP) exchanged.

Given that Raj received 14000 INR for 140 GBP, we can set up the following equation to find the exchange rate (X):

14000 INR = X GBP

Now, we solve for X:

X = 14000 INR / 140 GBP

X = 100 INR/GBP

So, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 INR per 1 GBP.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and threw away over the three days.

On Monday:
Found: 36 bottle caps
Thrown away: 45 bottle caps

Net gain on Monday = Found - Thrown away
Net gain on Monday = 36 - 45
Net gain on Monday = -9 bottle caps (meaning he lost 9 bottle caps)

On Tuesday:
Found: 58 bottle caps
Thrown away: 30 bottle caps

Net gain on Tuesday = Found - Thrown away
Net gain on Tuesday = 58 - 30
Net gain on Tuesday = 28 bottle caps

On Wednesday:
Found: 80 bottle caps
Thrown away: 70 bottle caps

Net gain on Wednesday = Found - Thrown away
Net gain on Wednesday = 80 - 70
Net gain on Wednesday = 10 bottle caps

Now, let's add up the net gains from each day to find the total number of bottle caps Danny found:

Total found = Net gain on Monday + Net gain on Tuesday + Net gain on Wednesday
Total found = (-9) + 28 + 10
Total found = 29 + 10
Total found = 39 bottle caps

Now, let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny threw away over the three days:

Total thrown away = 45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday)
Total thrown away = 145 bottle caps

Finally, let's find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away:

More found than thrown away = Total found - Total thrown away
More found than thrown away = 39 - 145
More found than thrown away = -106 bottle caps

This result indicates that Danny threw away 106 more bottle caps than he found over the three days. However, since we're looking for how many more he found than threw away, the correct interpretation is that he threw away 106 more bottle caps than he found.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's find out the total number of students after the new girls joined:

Initial number of girls = 706
New girls joined = 418

Total number of girls after joining = 706 + 418 = 1124

Now, let's add the initial number of boys to find the total number of students:

Total number of students = Total number of girls after joining + Number of boys
Total number of students = 1124 + 222 = 1346

The student-teacher ratio required by the school administration is 20:1. This means for every 20 students, there should be 1 teacher.

To find out how many teachers are needed, we divide the total number of students by the ratio number for students:

Number of teachers needed = Total number of students / Ratio number for students
Number of teachers needed = 1346 / 20

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

Number of teachers needed = 67.3

Rounding up, we need 68 teachers to maintain the student-teacher ratio of 20:1.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \). Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second line, the number of minutes for the first phone line would be \( x + 20 \).

The cost for the first phone line is then \( 0.15(x + 20) \) dollars, and the cost for the second phone line is \( 0.10x \) dollars.

The total bill for both lines is given as 56.00 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.15(x + 20) + 0.10x = 56.00 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.15x + 3.00 + 0.10x = 56.00 \]
\[ 0.25x + 3.00 = 56.00 \]
\[ 0.25x = 56.00 - 3.00 \]
\[ 0.25x = 53.00 \]
\[ x = \frac{53.00}{0.25} \]
\[ x = 212 \]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 212 minutes.

Now, we can find out how many minutes he used the first phone line:

\[ x + 20 = 212 + 20 \]
\[ x + 20 = 232 \]

Therefore, Milan was billed for a total of 212 minutes on the second phone line and 232 minutes on the first phone line, which adds up to:

\[ 212 + 232 = 444 \]

Milan was billed for a total of 444 minutes on both lines.
