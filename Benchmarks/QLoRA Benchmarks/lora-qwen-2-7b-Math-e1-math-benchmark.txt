### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed using the digits 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8, we need to place the smallest non-zero digit in the tens place and the next smallest non-zero digit in the ones place. Since we cannot use 0 as the first digit of a two-digit number, we will use 3 as the tens digit and 4 as the ones digit. Therefore, the smallest two-digit number we can form is 34.

Now, we know that when this number is subtracted by a certain number, it becomes 7. Let's call the certain number "x". So we have:

34 - x = 7

To find x, we simply add x to both sides of the equation:

34 = 7 + x

Then, subtract 7 from both sides:

34 - 7 = x

27 = x

Therefore, the certain number is 27.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (5, 3, 4, 8, and 2), we need to consider all possible combinations and choose the smallest one.

The possible two-digit numbers we can form are:
- 23
- 24
- 25
- 28
- 32
- 34
- 35
- 38
- 42
- 43
- 45
- 48
- 52
- 53
- 54
- 58
- 82
- 83
- 84
- 85
- 82

Among these, the smallest number is 23.

If this number is subtracted by a certain number and the result is 7, we can set up the equation:

23 - x = 7

To find the value of x, we add x to both sides of the equation and subtract 7 from both sides:

23 - 7 = x

16 = x

Therefore, the number that was subtracted from 23 to get 7 is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the amount of Indian Rupees (INR) received by the amount of British Pounds (GBP) spent.

Exchange Rate = INR / GBP

Given that Raj received 14000 INR for 140 GBP, we can calculate the exchange rate as follows:

Exchange Rate = 14000 INR / 140 GBP

Now, let's do the calculation:

Exchange Rate = 14000 / 140
Exchange Rate = 100 INR/GBP

So, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 INR per 1 GBP.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the number of bottle caps Danny found and the number he threw away each day:

On Monday:
Found: 36 bottle caps
Thrown away: 45 bottle caps

On Tuesday:
Found: 58 bottle caps
Thrown away: 30 bottle caps

On Wednesday:
Found: 80 bottle caps
Thrown away: 70 bottle caps

Now, let's calculate the net gain (found - thrown away) for each day:

Monday: 36 - 45 = -9 (he lost 9 bottle caps)
Tuesday: 58 - 30 = 28 (he gained 28 bottle caps)
Wednesday: 80 - 70 = 10 (he gained 10 bottle caps)

Now, let's add up the net gains for all three days to find out how many more bottle caps he found than those he threw away:

-9 (Monday) + 28 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) = 29

So, Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's find out the total number of students after the new girls joined the school.

Number of new girls = 418
Total number of girls after joining = 706 + 418 = 1124

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school after the new girls joined.

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 1124 + 222 = 1346

The school administration requires a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. This means for every 20 students, there should be 1 teacher.

To find out the number of teachers needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers needed = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers needed = 1346 / 20

Since you can't have a fraction of a teacher, we'll round up to the nearest whole number because even if the division results in a number less than 20, we still need a full teacher for that group of students.

Number of teachers needed = 67.3

Rounding up, we get:

Number of teachers needed = 68

Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers to maintain the required student-teacher ratio after accommodating the new students.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \). Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, the number of minutes he used the first phone line would be \( x + 20 \).

The cost for the first phone line is 15 cents per minute, so the cost for the first line is \( 0.15(x + 20) \).

The cost for the second phone line is 10 cents per minute, so the cost for the second line is \( 0.10x \).

The monthly fees for both lines are 3 dollars for the first line and 4 dollars for the second line, so the total monthly fees are \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) dollars.

The total bill for both lines last month was 56 dollars, which includes the monthly fees and the per-minute charges. So we can write the equation:

\[ 7 + 0.15(x + 20) + 0.10x = 56 \]

Now let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.15x + 3 + 3 + 0.10x = 56 \]
\[ 0.15x + 0.10x = 56 - 6 \]
\[ 0.25x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{0.25} \]
\[ x = 200 \]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 200 minutes.

Now we can find out how many minutes he used the first phone line:

\[ x + 20 = 200 + 20 \]
\[ x + 20 = 220 \]

Therefore, Milan was billed for a total of 220 minutes on the first phone line and 200 minutes on the second phone line, making it 420 minutes in total for both lines.
