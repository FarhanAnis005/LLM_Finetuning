### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the number of multiples of 4 less than 30, we can use the following equation:

Multiples of 4 = 4 x (number less than 30)

So, we need to find the number less than 30 that fits into 4:

30 / 4 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 multiples of 4 less than 30.

### Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the multiples of a number are equal to the number multiplied by the number of times it is divisible by another number. In this case, the multiples of 4 are equal to 4 x (number less than 30). To find the number less than 30 that fits into 4, we can divide 30 by 4:

30 / 4 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 multiples of 4 less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the number, we need to use the information given in the problem. The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is 34.

If we subtract a certain number from 34, the result will be 7. Let's say the number we subtract is x. Then, we can write the equation:

34 - x = 7

To solve for x, we can first add 34 to both sides of the equation:

x = 7 + 34

x = 41

Therefore, the number that can be subtracted from 34 to get 7 is 41.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 3, 4, 0, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8) is 30, because 0 cannot be the first digit of a two-digit number. If this number (30) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 30 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 30 - 7 x = 23 So, the certain number is 23.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 1, 8, and 9 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (5, 3, 1, 8, and 9) is 31, because 5 and 3 can be combined to make 8, and 1 can be added to 8 to make 9. If this number (31) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 31 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 31 - 7 x = 24 So, the certain number is 24.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?
To find the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar, we need to divide the amount of Korean Won Soojeong received by the amount of US Dollars she exchanged. So, the exchange rate (KRW/USD) is: 158,760 KRW / 140 USD = 1,134 KRW/USD Therefore, the exchange rate is 1,134 Korean Won to 1 US Dollar.
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Igor came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rubles in at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British Pounds, we need to divide the amount of Russian Rubles Igor received by the amount of British Pounds he exchanged. So, the exchange rate (RUB/GBP) is: 14000 RUB / 140 GBP = 100 RUB/GBP Therefore, the exchange rate is 100 Russian Rubles to 1 British Pound.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of minutes Milan used on both phone lines. We can start by finding the total number of minutes Milan used on each line.

For the first phone line, Milan used 20 more minutes than the second line, so the total number of minutes he used on the first line is:

20 + x = 56

where x is the total number of minutes Milan used on the second line.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

So Milan used a total of 36 minutes on the second line.

To find the total number of minutes Milan used on both lines, we add the number of minutes he used on each line:

Total minutes = 36 + 20 = 56

Therefore, Milan was billed for 56 minutes on both phone lines.
