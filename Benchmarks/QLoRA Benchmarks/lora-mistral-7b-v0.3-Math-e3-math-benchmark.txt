### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can divide 30 by 4 and then take the integer part of the result.

30 รท 4 = 7 with a remainder of 2.

This means that the largest multiple of 4 less than 30 is 7 times 4, which is 28.

Now, we need to count all the multiples of 4 from 1 to 28.

The first multiple of 4 is 4 itself, and the last multiple of 4 we've counted is 28.

To find the total number of multiples of 4 less than 30, we subtract the first multiple from the last multiple and then add 1 (because we've counted the first multiple twice).

28 - 4 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25

So, there are 25 multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is 30 (using the digits 0 and 3).

If this number is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the equation:

30 - x = 7

To find x, we add x to both sides of the equation:

30 - x + x = 7 + x
30 = 7 + x

Now, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for x:

30 - 7 = x
23 = x

So, the number that was subtracted to make 7 is 23.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is 32 (using the digits 3 and 2).

If this number is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the equation:

32 - x = 7

To find x, we add x to both sides of the equation:

32 - x + x = 7 + x
32 = 7 + x

Now, we subtract 7 from both sides to solve for x:

32 - 7 = x
25 = x

So, the number that was subtracted to get 7 from 32 is 25.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the amount of Indian Rupees (INR) by the amount of British Pounds (GBP) that Raj exchanged.

Raj exchanged 14000 INR for 140 GBP.

The exchange rate (ER) is calculated as follows:

ER = INR / GBP

ER = 14000 INR / 140 GBP

ER = 100 INR / 1 GBP

So, the exchange rate today is 100 INR for 1 GBP.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and the total number of bottle caps he threw away over the three days.

On Monday:
- Found: 36 bottle caps
- Threw away: 45 bottle caps

On Tuesday:
- Found: 58 bottle caps
- Threw away: 30 bottle caps

On Wednesday:
- Found: 80 bottle caps
- Threw away: 70 bottle caps

Now, let's add up the number of bottle caps Danny found each day:
36 (Monday) + 58 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 174 bottle caps

Next, let's add up the number of bottle caps Danny threw away each day:
45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 145 bottle caps

Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away:
174 (bottle caps found) - 145 (bottle caps thrown away) = 29 bottle caps

Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during the three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's find out the total number of students in the school after the new girls joined.

The number of girls before the new students joined is 706.
The number of new girls is 418.
So, the total number of girls after the new students joined is 706 + 418 = 1124 girls.

The number of boys before the new students joined is 222.
Since there are no new boys joining the school, the number of boys remains the same.

So, the total number of students after the new students joined is 1124 girls + 222 boys = 1346 students.

Now, we need to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. This means that for every 20 students, there should be 1 teacher.

To find out how many teachers are needed, we divide the total number of students by 20.

1346 students รท 20 = 67.3 teachers

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers to maintain the student-teacher ratio of 20:1.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used on the first phone line as \( x \) and the number of minutes on the second phone line as \( y \).

The cost for the first phone line is \( 3 + 0.15x \) dollars, and the cost for the second phone line is \( 4 + 0.10y \) dollars.

The total cost for both lines is \( 56.00 \) dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3 + 0.15x + 4 + 0.10y = 56.00 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7.15x + 4.10y = 56.00 \]

We know that \( x = y + 20 \) (Milan used 20 more minutes on the first line than the second line). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ 7.15(y + 20) + 4.10y = 56.00 \]

Expanding the equation, we get:

\[ 7.15y + 143 + 4.10y = 56.00 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 11.25y + 143 = 56.00 \]

Subtracting 143 from both sides, we get:

\[ 11.25y = 56.00 - 143 \]

\[ 11.25y = -87 \]

Dividing both sides by 11.25, we get:

\[ y = \frac{-87}{11.25} \]

\[ y = -7.76 \]

Since we cannot have a negative number of minutes, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or our calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The total cost for both lines is \( 56.00 \) dollars, and the difference in cost between the two lines is \( 3 - 4 = -1 \) dollar. This means that the total number of minutes used on both lines must be such that the cost of the first line is \( 3 \) dollars more than the cost of the second line.

Let's denote the total number of minutes used on both lines as \( z \). The cost for the first line is \( 3 + 0.15z \) dollars, and the cost for the second line is \( 4 + 0.10z \) dollars.

The difference in cost between the two lines is \( 3 - 4 = -1 \) dollar, so we can write:

\[ 3 + 0.15z = 4 + 0.10z - 1 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 0.15z = 0.10z + 1 \]

Subtracting \( 0.10z \) from both sides, we get:

\[ 0.05z = 1 \]

Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get:

\[ z = 20 \]

So, the total number of minutes used on both lines is \( 20 \) minutes.

However, we must re-evaluate the problem because the minutes used on the second line cannot be negative. Let's assume that Milan used \( 20 \) minutes on the first line and \( 0 \) minutes on the second line. This would mean that the cost for the first line is \( 3 + 0.15 \times 20 = 3 + 3 = 6 \) dollars, and the cost for the second line is \( 4 + 0.10 \times 0 = 4 \) dollars. The total cost for both lines would be \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) dollars, which is not the total bill of \( 56.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, we must re-evaluate the problem with the assumption that Milan used \( 20 \) minutes on the second line as well. This would mean that the cost for the first line is \( 3 + 0.15 \times 20 = 3 + 3 = 6 \) dollars, and the cost for the second line is \( 4 + 0.10 \times 20 = 4
