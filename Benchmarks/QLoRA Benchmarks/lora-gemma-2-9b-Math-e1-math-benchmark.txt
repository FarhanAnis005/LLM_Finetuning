### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2, we need to consider the smallest two-digit number that can be formed using these digits. Since we are looking for the smallest number, we should use the smallest digits available.

The smallest two-digit number that can be formed using the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is 32.

Now, we are told that when this number is subtracted by a certain number, it becomes 7. To find the number that was subtracted, we can set up the following equation:

32 - x = 7

where x is the number that was subtracted.

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

32 = 7 + x

Now, we can subtract 7 from both sides to isolate x:

32 - 7 = x

x = 25

So, the number that was subtracted from 32 to get 7 is 25.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 punds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds, we need to divide the amount of rupees Raj received by the amount of pounds he exchanged.

Raj received 14000 rupees for 140 pounds.

Exchange rate = Amount of rupees / Amount of pounds
Exchange rate = 14000 rupees / 140 pounds
Exchange rate = 100 rupees per pound

So, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 rupees per pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and the total number of bottle caps he threw away over the three days.

On Monday:
- He found 36 bottle caps.
- He threw away 45 old ones.
- Net gain on Monday: 36 - 45 = -9 bottle caps (He lost 9 bottle caps).

On Tuesday:
- He found 58 bottle caps.
- He threw away 30 old ones.
- Net gain on Tuesday: 58 - 30 = 28 bottle caps (He gained 28 bottle caps).

On Wednesday:
- He found 80 bottle caps.
- He threw away 70 old ones.
- Net gain on Wednesday: 80 - 70 = 10 bottle caps (He gained 10 bottle caps).

Now, let's add up the net gains from each day:
Total net gain = Monday's gain + Tuesday's gain + Wednesday's gain
Total net gain = -9 + 28 + 10
Total net gain = 29 bottle caps

Danny has 65 bottle caps left after all these days. This means that the total number of bottle caps he had before starting to collect on Monday was 65 + 29 = 94 bottle caps.

To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away, we subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he found:

Total bottle caps found = 36 (Monday) + 58 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 174 bottle caps
Total bottle caps thrown away = 45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 145 bottle caps

Difference = Total bottle caps found - Total bottle caps thrown away
Difference = 174 - 145
Difference = 29 bottle caps

Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of students after the new girls joined the school.

Total number of girls before new students joined = 706
Number of new girls = 418
Total number of girls after new students joined = 706 + 418 = 1124

Total number of boys = 222
Total number of students after new students joined = Total number of girls + Total number of boys
Total number of students = 1124 + 222 = 1346

Now, we need to determine the number of teachers required to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 20:1.

Student-teacher ratio = 20:1
This means that for every 20 students, there should be 1 teacher.

To find out how many teachers are needed for 1346 students, we divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio.

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Student-teacher ratio
Number of teachers = 1346 / 20
Number of teachers = 67.3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of teachers = 68

Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 20:1 after accommodating the new students.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes used on the second phone line as \( x \). Since Milan used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, the number of minutes used on the first phone line would be \( x + 20 \).

The cost for the first phone line would be the monthly fee plus the cost per minute multiplied by the number of minutes used:
\[ \text{Cost for first line} = 3 + 0.15(x + 20) \]

The cost for the second phone line would be the monthly fee plus the cost per minute multiplied by the number of minutes used:
\[ \text{Cost for second line} = 4 + 0.10x \]

The total cost for both lines is given as $56.00, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 3 + 0.15(x + 20) + 4 + 0.10x = 56 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 3 + 0.15x + 3 + 0.10x = 56 \]
\[ 0.15x + 0.10x = 56 - 3 - 3 \]
\[ 0.25x = 50 \]
\[ x = \frac{50}{0.25} \]
\[ x = 200 \]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 200 minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, the first phone line was used for:
\[ 200 + 20 = 220 \]

Now, let's find the total minutes used on both lines:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = x + (x + 20) \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 200 + 220 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 420 \]

Milan was billed for a total of 420 minutes on both lines.
