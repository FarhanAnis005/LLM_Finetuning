### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can start with the first multiple of 4, which is 4 itself, and then add 4 to find each subsequent multiple until we reach a number that is greater than or equal to 30.

The multiples of 4 less than 30 are:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24

There are 6 multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (5, 3, 4, 8, and 2), we need to arrange them in ascending order and then select the first two digits.

The numbers in ascending order are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of these numbers is 23.

Now, we need to find a certain number that, when subtracted from 23, results in 7.

Let's call the certain number "x".

So, we have:
23 - x = 7

To find "x", we need to subtract 7 from 23:
23 - 7 = 16

Therefore, the certain number "x" is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds, we can use the information given in the problem.

Raj exchanged 140 pounds for 14000 rupees. To find the exchange rate, we divide the number of rupees by the number of pounds:

Exchange rate = Number of rupees / Number of pounds
Exchange rate = 14000 rupees / 140 pounds
Exchange rate = 100 rupees / 1 pound

So, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 rupees per pound.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 3, 4, 0, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8) is 30, because 0 cannot be the first digit of a two-digit number. If this number (30) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 30 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 30 - 7 x = 23 So, the certain number is 23.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 1, 8, and 9 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (1, 3, 5, 8, and 9) is 13, because 1 cannot be the first digit of a two-digit number. If this number (13) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 13 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 13 - 7 x = 6 So, the certain number is 6.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?
To find the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar, we need to divide the amount of Korean Won Soojeong received by the amount of US Dollars she exchanged. So, the exchange rate (KRW/USD) is: 158,760 KRW / 140 USD = 1,134 KRW/USD Therefore, the exchange rate is 1,134 Korean Won to 1 US Dollar.
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Igor came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rubles in at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British Pounds, we need to divide the amount of Russian Rubles Igor received by the amount of British Pounds he exchanged. So, the exchange rate (RUB/GBP) is:

14000 RUB / 140 GBP = 100 RUB/GBP

Therefore, the exchange rate is 100 Russian Rubles to 1 British Pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away, we need to calculate the total number of bottle caps he found and the total number of bottle caps he threw away.

On Monday, he found 36 bottle caps and threw away 45 old ones.
On Tuesday, he found 58 bottle caps and threw away 30 old ones.
On Wednesday, he found 80 bottle caps and threw away 70 old ones.

So, the total number of bottle caps he found is:
36 (Monday) + 58 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 174 bottle caps

And the total number of bottle caps he threw away is:
45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 145 bottle caps

Now, we subtract the number of bottle caps he threw away from the number of bottle caps he found to get the difference:
174 (found) - 145 (threw away) = 29

Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of girls after 418 more girls joined the school:

Total girls = Original number of girls + Number of new girls
Total girls = 706 + 418
Total girls = 1124

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:

Total students = Total girls + Total boys
Total students = 1124 + 222
Total students = 1346

The student-teacher ratio is 20:1, which means for every 20 students, there should be 1 teacher. To find out how many teachers are needed for the current number of students, we divide the total number of students by 20:

Number of teachers = Total students / 20
Number of teachers = 1346 / 20
Number of teachers = 67.3

Since we cannot have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that the student-teacher ratio is maintained. Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers to accommodate the current number of students.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \) minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes, he used the first phone line for \( x + 20 \) minutes.

The total bill for the first phone line is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute for the number of minutes used. So the total bill for the first phone line is:
\[ 3 + 0.15(x + 20) \]

The total bill for the second phone line is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute for the number of minutes used. So the total bill for the second phone line is:
\[ 4 + 0.10x \]

The total bill for both phone lines is the sum of the bills for each line, which is given as $56.00. So we have the equation:
\[ (3 + 0.15(x + 20)) + (4 + 0.10x) = 56 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 3 + 0.15x + 3 + 0.60 + 0.10x = 56 \]
\[ 6 + 0.15x + 0.60 + 0.10x = 56 \]
\[ 6.60 + 0.25x = 56 \]
\[ 0.25x = 56 - 6.60 \]
\[ 0.25x = 49.40 \]
\[ x = \frac{49.40}{0.25} \]
\[ x = 197.60 \]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 197.60 minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes, he used the first phone line for:
\[ x + 20 = 197.60 + 20 = 217.60 \]

Now, let's find the total number of minutes Milan was billed for on both lines:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = x + (x + 20) \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 197.60 + 217.60 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 415.20 \]

Milan was billed for 415.20 minutes in total on both lines.
