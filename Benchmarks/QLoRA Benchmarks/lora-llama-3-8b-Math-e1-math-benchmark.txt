### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To form the smallest two-digit number using the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2, we need to arrange them in ascending order. The smallest two-digit number would be 23.

If we subtract a certain number from 23 and the result is 7, we can set up the following equation:

23 - x = 7

To find the value of x, we solve for x:

x = 23 - 7
x = 16

So, the number we are looking for is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to divide the amount of rupees received by the amount of pounds exchanged. 

Raj exchanged 140 pounds for 14000 rupees.

So, the exchange rate is:
Exchange Rate = Amount of Rupees / Amount of Pounds
Exchange Rate = 14000 rupees / 140 pounds

To calculate the exchange rate, we divide the number of rupees by the number of pounds:
Exchange Rate = 14000 / 140

Exchange Rate = 100 rupees per pound

Therefore, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today is 100 rupees per pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and the total number of bottle caps he threw away over the three days.

First, let's calculate the number of bottle caps he found:

Monday: 36
Tuesday: 58
Wednesday: 80

Total bottle caps found = 36 + 58 + 80 = 174

Now, let's calculate the number of bottle caps he threw away:

Monday: 45
Tuesday: 30
Wednesday: 70

Total bottle caps thrown away = 45 + 30 + 70 = 145

Now, we know that after throwing away 145 bottle caps, Danny has 65 bottle caps left. So, the total number of bottle caps he had before throwing away any is:

Total bottle caps before throwing away = Total bottle caps left + Total bottle caps thrown away
Total bottle caps before throwing away = 65 + 145 = 210

Now, we can calculate the number of bottle caps he found by subtracting the total bottle caps before throwing away from the total bottle caps he had after throwing away:

Bottle caps found = Total bottle caps before throwing away - Total bottle caps after throwing away
Bottle caps found = 210 - 65 = 145

Therefore, Danny found 145 bottle caps over the three days. To find out how many more bottle caps he found than those he threw away, we subtract the number of bottle caps thrown away from the number of bottle caps found:

Bottle caps found - Bottle caps thrown away = 145 - 145 = 0

Danny found exactly the same number of bottle caps as he threw away over the three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school before the new girls joined.

There are 706 girls and 222 boys, so the total number of students before the new girls joined is:
706 girls + 222 boys = 928 students

Now, let's calculate the number of students after the new girls joined. There are 418 more girls, so the total number of students after the new girls joined is:
706 girls + 418 girls = 1124 students

The school administration requires a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. To find out how many teachers are needed, we divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio.

1124 students / 20:1 = 56.2 teachers

Since you can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that there are enough teachers to maintain the required ratio.

56.2 teachers rounded up to the nearest whole number is 57 teachers.

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \) minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line, the number of minutes he used the first phone line is \( x + 20 \) minutes.

For the first phone line, the total cost is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute used. So, the cost for the first phone line is:
\[ 3 + \frac{15}{100}(x + 20) \]

For the second phone line, the total cost is the monthly fee plus the cost per minute used. So, the cost for the second phone line is:
\[ 4 + \frac{10}{100}x \]

The total cost for both lines is the sum of the costs for each line:
\[ 3 + \frac{15}{100}(x + 20) + 4 + \frac{10}{100}x = 56 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 3 + \frac{15}{100}x + 20 + \frac{15}{100} + 4 + \frac{10}{100}x = 56 \]
\[ \frac{15}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{10}{100}x + 3 + 20 + 4 = 56 \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + 3 + 20 + 4 = 56 \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + 27 = 56 \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{2700}{100} = \frac{5600}{100} \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{27}{1} = \frac{56}{1} \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{2700}{1000} = \frac{5600}{1000} \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{56}{10} \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{270}{100} = \frac{560}{100} \]
\[ \frac{25}{100}x + \frac{15}{100} + \frac{270}{100} = \frac{560}{100} \]
\[ \frac{25x}{100} + \frac{15x}{100} + \frac{270}{100} = \frac{560}{100} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{270}{100} = \frac{560}{100} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{2700}{10000} = \frac{56000}{10000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{270}{1000} = \frac{560}{100} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{270}{1000} = \frac{56000}{10000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{270}{1000} = \frac{5600}{1000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{56}{10} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{270}{1000} = \frac{560}{1000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{56}{10} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{560}{1000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{560}{1000} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{56}{10} \]
\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{560}{1000} \]

\[ \frac{40x}{100} + \frac{27}{10} = \frac{560}{1000} \]
