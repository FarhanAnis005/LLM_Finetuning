### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
Let's denote the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 as "AB", where A and B are the digits.

According to the problem, when this number is subtracted by a certain number, it becomes 7. So we can write the equation:

AB - X = 7

We need to find the value of X.

The smallest two-digit number that can be formed with the digits 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is 30. So, if we subtract 30 from 7, we get:

7 - 30 = -23

This means that the number X is -23. However, since we are dealing with two-digit numbers, we cannot have a negative number as the difference. This indicates that the problem might have a mistake or is not solvable with the given information.

If we are to find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed with the digits 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8, it would be 30. If we subtract 30 from 7, we get -23, which is not a valid two-digit number. Therefore, the problem might need to be rephrased or the information provided might be incorrect.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2, we need to consider the possible combinations of these digits. The smallest two-digit number that can be formed is 35 (since 25 is not a two-digit number).

Now, we need to subtract a certain number from 35 to get 7. Let's call this certain number "x". So, we have:

35 - x = 7

To find x, we add x to both sides of the equation:

35 + x = 7 + x

Now, we subtract 35 from both sides:

x = 7 - 35

x = -28

So, the number that needs to be subtracted from 35 to get 7 is -28. However, since we cannot subtract a negative number from a positive number, we need to add -28 to 35 to get the result:

35 + (-28) = 7

Therefore, the number is 7.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the net gain in bottle caps for each day:

On Monday:
Danny found 36 bottle caps and threw away 45 old ones.
Net gain on Monday = 36 - 45 = -9 bottle caps

On Tuesday:
Danny found 58 bottle caps and threw away 30 old ones.
Net gain on Tuesday = 58 - 30 = 28 bottle caps

On Wednesday:
Danny found 80 bottle caps and threw away 70 old ones.
Net gain on Wednesday = 80 - 70 = 10 bottle caps

Now, let's add up the net gains for all three days:
Net gain on Monday + Net gain on Tuesday + Net gain on Wednesday = -9 + 28 + 10 = 29 bottle caps

Danny started with some old bottle caps and ended up with 65 bottle caps left. To find out how many more bottle caps he found than those he threw away, we subtract the number of old bottle caps he started with from the number he ended with:

65 (bottle caps left) - (number of old bottle caps) = 65 - (number of old bottle caps)

We know that Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away, so we can set up the equation:

65 - (number of old bottle caps) = 29

Now, we solve for the number of old bottle caps:

(number of old bottle caps) = 65 - 29
(number of old bottle caps) = 36

Danny started with 36 old bottle caps. Therefore, he found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during the three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's find out the total number of students in the school before the new girls joined.

Total students before new girls joined = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total students before new girls joined = 706 + 222
Total students before new girls joined = 928

Now, let's find out the total number of students after the new girls joined.

Total students after new girls joined = Total students before new girls joined + Number of new girls
Total students after new girls joined = 928 + 418
Total students after new girls joined = 1346

Now, we need to find out the student-teacher ratio that the school administration wants to maintain.

Student-teacher ratio = 20:1

To find the number of teachers needed, we can set up a proportion:

Number of students / Number of teachers = 20 / 1

Let's call the number of teachers "T".

928 / T = 20 / 1

To solve for T, we can cross-multiply:

928 * 1 = 20 * T

928 = 20T

Now, we can solve for T:

T = 928 / 20
T = 46.4

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of teachers needed = 47

So, the school should have 47 teachers to maintain the student-teacher ratio of 20:1 after accommodating the new students.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used on the first phone line as \( M_1 \) and the number of minutes he used on the second phone line as \( M_2 \).

From the information given, we know that \( M_1 = M_2 + 20 \) minutes.

The monthly fee for the first phone line is $3, and the cost per minute is $0.15. The total cost for the first phone line is therefore \( 3 + 0.15M_1 \) dollars.

The monthly fee for the second phone line is $4, and the cost per minute is $0.10. The total cost for the second phone line is therefore \( 4 + 0.10M_2 \) dollars.

The total cost for both lines is $56, and this is the sum of the costs for both lines:

\( 3 + 0.15M_1 + 4 + 0.10M_2 = 56 \)

Now, let's substitute \( M_1 \) with \( M_2 + 20 \) in the equation:

\( 3 + 0.15(M_2 + 20) + 4 + 0.10M_2 = 56 \)

Simplify the equation:

\( 3 + 0.15M_2 + 20 + 0.10M_2 + 4 = 56 \)

\( 3 + 0.15M_2 + 20 + 0.10M_2 + 4 = 56 \)

\( 3 + 0.25M_2 + 24 = 56 \)

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\( 3 + 0.25M_2 = 56 - 24 \)

\( 3 + 0.25M_2 = 32 \)

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\( 0.25M_2 = 32 - 3 \)

\( 0.25M_2 = 29 \)

Divide both sides by 0.25:

\( M_2 = \frac{29}{0.25} \)

\( M_2 = 116 \) minutes

Now that we know Milan used 116 minutes on the second phone line, we can find out how many minutes he used on the first phone line:

\( M_1 = M_2 + 20 \)

\( M_1 = 116 + 20 \)

\( M_1 = 136 \) minutes

Now, let's find the total number of minutes Milan was billed for on both lines:

\( M_1 + M_2 = 136 + 116 \)

\( M_1 + M_2 = 252 \) minutes

Milan was billed for a total of 252 minutes on both lines.
