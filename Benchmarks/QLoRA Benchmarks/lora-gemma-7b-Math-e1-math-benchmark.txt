### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can start by dividing 30 by 4 and then taking the integer part of the result.

30 รท 4 = 7.5

Since we are looking for multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we need to consider the whole numbers less than 7.5.

The whole numbers less than 7.5 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28.

Now, we need to check which of these numbers are multiples of 4.

The multiples of 4 among the numbers less than 30 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28.

So, there are 7 multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is 30 (since 0 cannot be the first digit in a two-digit number).

If we subtract this number from a certain number and the result is 7, we can set up the equation:

Certain number - 30 = 7

To find the certain number, we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

Certain number = 7 + 30
Certain number = 37

So, the certain number is 37.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
To find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2, we need to consider the smallest possible two-digit number that can be made with these digits. Since we are looking for the smallest number, we should use the smallest digits available.

The smallest two-digit number that can be formed with two of the given digits is 34 (using the digits 3 and 4).

Now, we need to find the smallest two-digit number that can be formed with two of the given digits that is greater than 34. The next smallest number after 34 is 43 (using the digits 4 and 3).

Now, we subtract the smallest two-digit number from the next smallest two-digit number to find the number that was subtracted to get 7.

43 (next smallest number) - 34 (smallest number) = 9

So, the number that was subtracted to get 7 is 9.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 punds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to determine the value of 1 pound in rupees. We are given that Raj exchanged 14000 rupees for 140 pounds.

First, let's find the value of 1 pound in rupees:

14000 rupees / 140 pounds = 100 rupees/pound

So, 1 pound is equal to 100 rupees.

Now, we can find the exchange rate by dividing the value of 1 pound in rupees by the value of 1 pound in pounds:

100 rupees/pound รท 1 pound = 100 rupees/pound

Therefore, the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British Pounds today is 100 rupees to 1 pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and the total number he threw away during these three days.

On Monday, he found 36 bottle caps and threw away 45 old ones. So, he had 36 - 45 = -9 bottle caps left. Since he can't have a negative number of bottle caps, we assume he started with none and found 36 on Monday.

On Tuesday, he found 58 bottle caps and threw away 30 old ones. So, he had 58 - 30 = 28 bottle caps left.

On Wednesday, he found 80 more bottle caps and threw away 70 old ones. So, he had 80 + 28 = 108 bottle caps left.

After all these days, he has 65 bottle caps left.

To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than those he threw away, we need to add the bottle caps he found to the bottle caps he had left after Wednesday and then subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away.

Total bottle caps found = 36 (Monday) + 58 (Tuesday) + 80 (Wednesday) = 174
Total bottle caps left after Wednesday = 108
Total bottle caps thrown away = 45 (Monday) + 30 (Tuesday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 145

Now, we subtract the total number of bottle caps thrown away from the total number of bottle caps found:

174 (found) - 145 (thrown away) = 29

Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school after the new girls joined.

The original number of girls is 706. After 418 more girls joined, the new number of girls is:
706 + 418 = 1124 girls

The original number of boys is 222. Since there are no new boys, the number of boys remains the same:
222 boys

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:
Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
Total number of students = 1124 girls + 222 boys
Total number of students = 1346 students

The school administration requires a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. This means that for every 20 students, there is 1 teacher.

To find out how many teachers are needed for 1346 students, we divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Student-teacher ratio
Number of teachers = 1346 students / 20
Number of teachers = 1346 students / 20
Number of teachers = 67.3

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the school should have 68 teachers now.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes used on the first phone line as \( M \) and the number of minutes used on the second phone line as \( N \).

The cost for the first phone line is \( 3 + 0.15M \) dollars per month, and the cost for the second phone line is \( 4 + 0.10N \) dollars per month.

According to the information given, the total cost for both lines last month was $56.00. So we can write the equation:

\[ 3 + 0.15M + 4 + 0.10N = 56 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7 + 0.15M + 0.10N = 56 \]

Now, we know that \( M = N + 20 \) (since the first phone line was used for 20 more minutes than the second phone line). We can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 7 + 0.15(N + 20) + 0.10N = 56 \]

Expanding the equation, we get:

\[ 7 + 0.15N + 3 + 0.10N = 56 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 10 + 0.25N = 56 \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):

\[ 0.25N = 56 - 10 \]
\[ 0.25N = 46 \]
\[ N = \frac{46}{0.25} \]
\[ N = 184 \]

Now that we have the number of minutes used on the second phone line, we can find the number of minutes used on the first phone line:

\[ M = N + 20 \]
\[ M = 184 + 20 \]
\[ M = 204 \]

Now, we can find the total number of minutes used on both lines:

\[ Total = M + N \]
\[ Total = 204 + 184 \]
\[ Total = 388 \]

So, in total, Milan was billed for 388 minutes on both lines.
