### Input:
Find how many multiples of 4 are less than 30.

### Response:
To find the multiples of 4 that are less than 30, we can start with the first multiple of 4, which is 4 itself, and then continue adding 4 to find each subsequent multiple until we reach a number that is not less than 30.

The multiples of 4 less than 30 are:
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28.

Counting them, we have 7 multiples of 4 that are less than 30.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given digits is 30. If this number is subtracted by a certain number and the result is 7, we can set up the equation:

30 - x = 7

To find the value of x, we add 30 to both sides of the equation:

30 - x + 30 = 7 + 30

This simplifies to:

60 - x = 37

Now, we solve for x by subtracting 60 from both sides:

60 - x - 60 = 37 - 60

This gives us:

-x = -23

To find the value of x, we multiply both sides by -1:

x = 23

Therefore, the number that was subtracted from 30 to get 7 is 23.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by using two of the digits 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is 23 (using the digits 2 and 3).

Let's call the certain number we are looking for "x". According to the problem, when we subtract x from 23, we get 7.

So, we can write the equation:

23 - x = 7

Now, we solve for x:

x = 23 - 7
x = 16

Therefore, the number we are looking for is 16.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate, we need to determine how many rupees Raj gets for one pound. Since Raj exchanged 140 pounds for 14,000 rupees, we can set up the following equation:

140 pounds = 14,000 rupees

Now, we want to find out how many rupees 1 pound is worth. We can do this by dividing the number of rupees by the number of pounds:

14,000 rupees / 140 pounds = 100 rupees/pound

So, the exchange rate today is 100 rupees for 1 British pound.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 3, 4, 0, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8) is 30, because 0 cannot be the first digit of a two-digit number. If this number (30) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number: 30 - x = 7 Now, we solve for x: x = 30 - 7 x = 23 So, the certain number is 23.
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 1, 8, and 9 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (1, 3, 5, 8, and 9) is 13. If this number (13) is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7, we can set up the following equation to find the certain number:

13 - x = 7

Now, we solve for x:

x = 13 - 7
x = 6

So, the certain number is 6.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Soojeong came back from a trip to the U.S. and exchanged the remaining 140 dollars for 158,760 won in Korean money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar today?
To find the exchange rate of the Korean Won to the US Dollar, we need to divide the amount of Korean Won Soojeong received by the amount of US Dollars she exchanged. So, the exchange rate (KRW/USD) is: 158,760 KRW / 140 USD = 1,134 KRW/USD Therefore, the exchange rate is 1,134 Korean Won to 1 US Dollar.
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Igor came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rubles in at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of the Russian Rubles to the British Pounds, we need to divide the amount of Russian Rubles Igor received by the amount of British Pounds he exchanged. So, the exchange rate (RUB/GBP) is:

14000 RUB / 140 GBP = 100 RUB/GBP

Therefore, the exchange rate is 100 Russian Rubles to 1 British Pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and the total number he threw away.

Found:
Monday: 36 caps
Tuesday: 58 caps
Wednesday: 80 caps
Total found: 36 + 58 + 80 = 174 caps

Threw away:
Monday: 45 caps
Tuesday: 30 caps
Wednesday: 70 caps
Total threw away: 45 + 30 + 70 = 145 caps

Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps Danny found than he threw away:
Found - Threw away = 174 - 145 = 29 caps

So, Danny found 29 more bottle caps than those he threw away during these three days.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of girls after 418 more girls joined the school:

Total girls = Original girls + New girls
Total girls = 706 + 418
Total girls = 1124

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school:

Total students = Total girls + Total boys
Total students = 1124 + 222
Total students = 1346

The school administration requires a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. To find out how many teachers are needed, we divide the total number of students by the ratio:

Number of teachers = Total students / Student-teacher ratio
Number of teachers = 1346 / 20
Number of teachers = 67.3

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the students:

Number of teachers = 68

Therefore, there should be 68 teachers in the school now to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 20:1.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes Milan used the second phone line as \( x \) minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, he used the first phone line for \( x + 20 \) minutes.

The cost for the first phone line is \( 3 + 0.15(x + 20) \) dollars, and the cost for the second phone line is \( 4 + 0.10x \) dollars.

The total cost for both lines is the sum of these two costs, which we know is \( 56.00 \) dollars. So we can set up the following equation:

\[ 3 + 0.15(x + 20) + 4 + 0.10x = 56 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 7 + 0.15x + 3 + 0.10x = 56 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 0.15x + 0.10x + 10 = 56 \]

\[ 0.25x + 10 = 56 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 0.25x = 46 \]

Divide both sides by 0.25:

\[ x = \frac{46}{0.25} \]

\[ x = 184 \]

So, Milan used the second phone line for 184 minutes. Since he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second, he used the first phone line for \( 184 + 20 = 204 \) minutes.

The total number of minutes Milan was billed for on both lines is the sum of the minutes used on each line:

\[ 204 + 184 = 388 \]

Milan was billed for 388 minutes in total on both lines.
