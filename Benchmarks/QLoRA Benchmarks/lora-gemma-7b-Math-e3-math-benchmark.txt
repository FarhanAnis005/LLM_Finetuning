### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given digits (0, 3, 4, 6, and 8) is 30.

If we subtract a certain number from 30 to get 7, we can set up the equation:

30 - x = 7

To find the value of x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 7
x = 23

So, the number that was subtracted from 30 to get 7 is 23.

### Input:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of 5, 3, 4, 8, and 2 is subtracted by a certain number and it became 7. Find the number.

### Response:
The smallest two-digit number that can be formed by two of the given numbers (5, 3, 4, 8, and 2) is 34 (since 3 is the smallest and 4 is the second smallest).

If we subtract a certain number from 34 to get 7, we can set up the equation:

34 - x = 7

To find x, we subtract 34 from 7:

x = 34 - 7
x = 27

So the number that was subtracted from 34 to get 7 is 27.

### Input:
The exchange rate refers to the rate at which one country's currency is exchanged for another country's currency. Raj came back from a trip to the U.K and exchanged the remaining 140 pounds for 14000 rupees in Indian money at the bank today. What is the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees to the British pounds today?

### Response:
To find the exchange rate of Indian rupees to British pounds, we need to divide the number of rupees Raj exchanged by the number of pounds he had.

Raj exchanged 14000 rupees for 140 pounds.

So, the exchange rate is:

14000 rupees / 140 pounds = 100 rupees/pound

Therefore, the exchange rate of Indian rupees to British pounds today is 100 rupees to 1 pound.

### Input:
Danny collects bottle caps. On Monday, he went to the park and found 36 bottle caps but he threw away 45 old ones. On Tuesday, he visited the beach and found another 58 bottle caps, however, he ended up throwing away 30 from his old collection. And then on Wednesday, he went to a concert where he found 80 more bottle caps but he decided to throw away another 70 old ones. After all these, he has 65 bottle caps left. How many more bottle caps did Danny find than those he threw away during these three days?

### Response:
Let's calculate the total number of bottle caps Danny found and threw away during these three days.

On Monday, he found 36 bottle caps and threw away 45 old ones. So, he added 36 to his collection and subtracted 45 from his old collection, resulting in a net increase of 36 - 45 = -9 bottle caps.

On Tuesday, he found 58 bottle caps and threw away 30 old ones. So, he added 58 to his collection and subtracted 30 from his old collection, resulting in a net increase of 58 - 30 = 28 bottle caps.

On Wednesday, he found 80 more bottle caps and threw away 70 old ones. So, he added 80 to his collection and subtracted 70 from his old collection, resulting in a net increase of 80 - 70 = 10 bottle caps.

Now, let's add up the net increases from all three days: -9 (Monday) + 28 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) = 39 bottle caps.

Danny started with a certain number of bottle caps and ended up with 65 bottle caps. To find out how many more bottle caps he found than those he threw away, we subtract the total number of bottle caps he threw away from the total number he had at the end.

The total number of bottle caps he threw away is the sum of the bottle caps he threw away on Monday and Wednesday, which is 45 (Monday) + 70 (Wednesday) = 115 bottle caps.

So, the number of bottle caps Danny found more than those he threw away is 65 (total at the end) - 115 (total thrown away) = -50 bottle caps.

However, since we can't have a negative number of bottle caps, we need to re-evaluate our calculations. It seems there is an error in the problem statement or in our calculations. We should have added the net increases to the initial number of bottle caps Danny had, not subtracted.

Let's re-calculate:

The initial number of bottle caps Danny had is not given in the problem statement. We need to know this number to calculate the correct difference between the bottle caps he found and those he threw away.

If we assume that Danny started with 0 bottle caps, then the difference would be 65 (total at the end) - 115 (total thrown away) = -50 bottle caps.

However, if Danny started with a different number of bottle caps, we would need more information to calculate the correct difference.

### Input:
In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. The school administration requires maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. After accommodating the new students, how many teachers should be there in the school now?

### Response:
First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school after the new girls joined.

The original number of girls was 706, and 418 more girls joined, so the new number of girls is:
706 + 418 = 1124 girls

The original number of boys was 222.

Now, let's add the new number of girls to the original number of boys to get the total number of students in the school:
1124 girls + 222 boys = 1346 students

The school administration requires a student-teacher ratio of 20:1. This means that for every 20 students, there is 1 teacher.

To find out how many teachers are needed for 1346 students, we divide the total number of students by the student-teacher ratio:
1346 students / 20 = 67.3

Since we can't have a fraction of a teacher, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the school will need 68 teachers to maintain the student-teacher ratio.

Question: 10

### Input:
Milan has two phone lines for his long-distance phone service. For the first phone line, he pays a 3 dollar monthly fee plus 15 cents per minute, and for the second phone line, he pays a 4 dollar monthly fee plus 10 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's total long-distance bill was 56.00 dollars for both lines, and he used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line. How many minutes in total was Milan billed for on both lines?

### Response:
Let's denote the number of minutes used on the first phone line as \( x \) and the number of minutes used on the second phone line as \( y \).

According to the problem, Milan used the first phone line for 20 more minutes than the second phone line, so we can write the following equation:
\[ x = y + 20 \]

The cost for the first phone line is \( 3 + 0.15x \) dollars, and the cost for the second phone line is \( 4 + 0.10y \) dollars.

The total cost for both lines last month was $56, so we can write the following equation:
\[ 3 + 0.15x + 4 + 0.10y = 56 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7 + 0.15x + 0.10y = 56 \]

Now, we can substitute \( x \) with \( y + 20 \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 7 + 0.15(y + 20) + 0.10y = 56 \]

Expanding the equation, we get:
\[ 7 + 0.15y + 3 + 0.15 \times 20 + 0.10y = 56 \]
\[ 10 + 0.25y + 3 + 3 = 56 \]
\[ 16 + 0.25y + 0.10y = 56 \]
\[ 16 + 0.35y = 56 \]

Now, we can solve for \( y \):
\[ 0.35y = 56 - 16 \]
\[ 0.35y = 40 \]
\[ y = \frac{40}{0.35} \]
\[ y = 114.2857 \approx 114 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we'll round \( y \) to the nearest whole number, which is 114 minutes.

Now, we can find \( x \) using the first equation:
\[ x = y + 20 \]
\[ x = 114 + 20 \]
\[ x = 134 \]

So, the number of minutes used on the first phone line is 134 and the number of minutes used on the second phone line is 114.

The total number of minutes billed for on both lines is the sum of \( x \) and \( y \):
\[ 134 + 114 = 248 \]

Therefore, Milan was billed for a total of 248 minutes on both lines last month.
